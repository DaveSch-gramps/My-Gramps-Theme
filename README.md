# My Gramps Theme

Modified Adwaita theme that reduces the size of Tabs

This Theme was modified to alter how the Gramps genealogy program displays and NOT as a basic Linux theme. As I am not a Linux user, I make no claim how the theme will work as an overall theme.

As a Gramps theme on a Windows system, the Gramps Themes addon must be installed. Install the theme folder in  'C:\Users\<username>\.themes\My Gramps Themes'.

See https://gramps-project.org/wiki/index.php/Addon:Themes for more information. Note: if the .themes folder does not already exist, create it.

I am not a dark theme user but I have made a few changes to the Tabs in the Dark theme. The Tabs will appear smaller than the Gramps Adwaita display theme so that the tabs in the person edit window should all be visible without scrolling.
