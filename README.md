# My Gramps Theme

Modified Adwaita theme that reduces the size of Tabs

This Theme was modified to alter how the Gramps genealogy program displays and NOT as a basic Linux theme.

Right now, it makes no changes to the Dark theme. I am not a dark theme user so it may take me awhile to make the changes to the Tabs. What you will see in the dark theme is the normal Gramps Adwaita dark theme.
